<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Fatima. I currently work as a Technical Support Engineer. Outdide of working, I like to spend time with my family. One of my hobbies is reading. And I also love all stationary things!

</p>
  
 <p>I am currently in the process of learning Web Development, Python, and SQL. In my position at work, we work with MongoDB and that sparked the interest in learning about coding. I started learning Web Development, Python, and SQL this year. It is 
  my goal to learn about web development by the end of the year and create my own web page. Eventually, I would like to create my own mobile app that is the planner I would use.
